### Trust Phase: 🏗️ CREATION

- **Total Assets (Vault)**: €0.00

### 🕯️ The Concept of Sustainability

> **10% Rule**: New trustees acknowledge the endured pain of the pioneers by contributing 10% of their effort to reimburse this asset.

### 🔭 Perspective for the Future
In a perfect world, equal fundraising success would be the norm. In a **better world**, no Trustee would need to raise money at all.

The **Umbrella Fund** represents a developmental opportunity to experiment with marketing the **Global Gaza Resilience Fund** for its beneficiaries.
This endeavor aims, over a long timeframe, to become a utility for Palestinians and potentially other protected populations.
