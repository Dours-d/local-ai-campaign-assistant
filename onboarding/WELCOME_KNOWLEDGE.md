# Welcome to the Gaza Resilience Project

We are honored to support your path toward rebuilding and dignity. To maximize the impact of every donation, we consolidate all our efforts into a **Global Gaza Resilience Fund**. 

By joining this fund, you are assigned a unique **Beneficiary ID**. This allows us to track your specific allocation while avoiding the massive bank fees that would destroy smaller individual campaigns.

## 1. Absolute Transparency (Internal IDs)
Every donation intended for you is tracked by your **Beneficiary ID** (e.g., Mohammed-001). While the fund appears large to the public, our internal ledger ensures every cent is accounted for your specific family.

## 2. Zero-Waste Disbursement (€500+ Threshold)
Platform bank fees ($12-$20 per transfer) and currency conversion are high. By batching our withdrawals through a single large fund, we preserve the value of your aid. We prioritize payouts in units of **€500** to ensure you get the maximum amount possible.

## 3. 25% Sustainability Fee
To ensure the long-term survival and growth of this aid operation, a **25% sustainability fee** is applied to all funds raised. This allows us to keep the servers running, develop the automation tools that help hundreds of families simultaneously, and expand our reach to more beneficiaries.

## 4. Monday Reporting Cycle
Every **Monday**, we perform a full audit of all funds raised across all platforms (LaunchGood, Whydonate). Reports are generated automatically and shared with our community.

## 5. Automated Iteration Link
