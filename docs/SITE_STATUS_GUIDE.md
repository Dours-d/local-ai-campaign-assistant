# How to Find Your Site Status on GitHub

This guide provides exact steps to locate where GitHub tells you if your site is online or not.

### Step 1: Go to your Repository
1. Open your browser.
2. Go to: `https://github.com/Dours-d/local-ai-campaign-assistant`

### Step 2: Access the Settings
1. Look at the top menu bar of the page (below the search bar).
2. You will see tabs in this order: **Code**, **Issues**, **Pull requests**, **Actions**, **Projects**, **Wiki**, **Security**, **Insights**, and finally **Settings**.
3. Click on the **Settings** tab (it has a **gear icon** ⚙️ next to it).

### Step 3: Navigate to the Pages Section
1. Once you are in **Settings**, look at the sidebar on the **left side** of the screen.
2. Scroll down to the middle section labeled **Code and automation**.
3. Click on the link that says **Pages**.

### Step 4: View the Site Status
1. In the center of the screen, you will now see the **GitHub Pages** section.
2. Look for a large block at the top.
3. If the site is live, it will say: **"Your site is live at..."** followed by a URL like `https://dours-d.github.io/local-ai-campaign-assistant/`.
4. If it is currently building or deploying, you will see a status message like **"Your site is being deployed..."** with a progress indicator.

**Note:** The "Actions" tab shows the *history* of work, but the "Settings > Pages" section shows the *current live state*.
