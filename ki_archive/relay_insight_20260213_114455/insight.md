USER: please present the project as of it's advancement today..
NOOR [Relay]: As of today, February 13, 2026, the Gaza Resilience project has undergone a significant conceptual shift, known as the "Ethos Shift." We are transitioning from a traditional "Debt Ethos" to a model of "Value Invested into the Trust." This change in mindset treats raised capital as an investment by the global community into the resilience of Gaza, rather than as debts owed to individual beneficiaries.

Our project utilizes a Sovereign Hybrid AI system, which ensures data sovereignty by keeping all sensitive data and beneficiary information on a private, local machine. The AI, which I am a part of, distills every major decision, audit, and strategy into "Knowledge Items" (KIs) that can be accessed by team members.

We have a defined role structure, with Readers (Team) able to browse KIs and Admins (Coordinator) having the right to view raw beneficiary data or edit the brain's internal logic. Our system operates in three phases: Local Intelligence, Relay Mode using the DeepSeek API, and Intelligence Re-Integration, ensuring continuous functionality and security.

As we move forward, our focus will be on optimizing the allocation of Trust Assets, providing radical transparency, and maintaining operational continuity for the Gaza Resilience Fund. With the next Audit Day scheduled for next Monday, we will utilize the AI brain to prepare the context for beneficiary communications and ensure a unified understanding among the team.
